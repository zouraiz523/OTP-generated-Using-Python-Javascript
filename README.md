Introduction

This repository demonstrates the generation of One-Time Passwords (OTPs) using Python and JavaScript. OTPs are often used for secure authentication processes, and this project showcases OTP generation in two popular languages.

Features
Python OTP Generation:

Utilizes the pyotp library.
Generates a random base32-encoded secret key.
Creates a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) object.
Prints the generated secret and current OTP.
Simulates OTP change over time with a sleep period.
JavaScript OTP Generation:

Defines a JavaScript function generateOTP.
Generates a random numeric OTP with a specified length.
Demonstrates random number generation and string manipulation.
Installation
Python (for OTP Generation)
bash
Copy code
pip install pyotp
No specific installation is required for the JavaScript code.
